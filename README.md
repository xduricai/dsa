# data structures and nyalgorithms :3c  

- This repository contains various data structure and algorithm implementations that I wrote as practice while following [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen)'s [DSA course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)  

- Proper unit tests may be added in the future if I stop being lazy (highly unlikely)
